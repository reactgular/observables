Applies a [mergeMap](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/mergeMap) to the outer observable, and maps the inner observable to an array that contains
the value of both the outer and inner observables as `Observable<[outer, inner]>`.

```typescript
withMergeMap<T, R>(inner: (x: T) => Observable<R>): OperatorFunction<T, [T, R]>
```
