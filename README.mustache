## What is Observables?

Observables is a small rxjs library that contains handy operators and utilities.

## Why use this rxjs library?

These operators and utilities are the result doing the same thing frequently with rxjs, and deciding to create
a library to share these common things across projects. They are based upon my personal experiences, and can honestly
say that I use this library in every project. I hope you'll find it as handy as I have.

## Installation

To get started, install the package from npm.

```bash
npm install @reactgular/observables
```

## Usage

Utility functions are imported directly from the package path `@reactgular/observables`, but operators are
imported from `@reactgular/observables/operators`.

For example;

```typescript
import {windowResize} from '@reactgular/observables';
import {distinctStringify} from '@reactgular/observables/operators';

windowResize(250).pipe(
distinctStringify()
).subscribe(v => console.log(v));
```
